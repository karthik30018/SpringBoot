## Maven

- Helps to write, compile, run, deploy the program.
- Project mamagenent tool
- Provide external libraries
- Provide dependencies and plugins
- The project structure will remains same if the project is opened in different IDEs

**Archetypes** -  A templating tool [An existing template provided by Maven].

**Dependencies -> Jar file**

### Note :- To download external jar or libraries use **MVN Repository**.

**pom.xml -> Project Object Model** [To handle maven we have to do changes here]

- Every library goes in three things **(GAV)**
- G -> GroupID (Unique)
- A -> ArtifactsId (Project Name)
- V -> VersionId (Version)

### To add dependencies in Maven

- Create a dependencies tag in pom.xml `<dependencies>`
- Inside add the `<dependency>` which you want for the project
- Press sync Maven changes or **Maven -> Sync/Reload All Maven Project**

  **Transitive Dependency** -> When a dependencies is dependent on other.

  **Effective POM** -> Parenyt of POM
  - Right click on pom.xml -> Maven -> Show effective POM
  - Whatever operation we perform on pom.xml thechanges are done automatically to Effective POM which the project reads.

  **Maven Archetype** -> Templates are called as Archetypes [While creating the project you have to select the archetype].

  **Note ->Try not to use vulnerable libraries.**

  **M2 folder** -> First Maven search dependencies in M2 folder then on internet.
  - If the dependencies is not present in M2 file the Maven will download from internet and keep a copy of that in the M2 file for future use.
  - If any issue with dependencies version go to  M2 folder then delete the version.
